You are solving the 1D Cutting Stock Problem.

**Problem:**
You have wholesale stock pieces of length 200 units.
You need to cut the following pieces: [80, 60, 40, 120, 75, 45, 90, 55, 100, 65, 35, 85]

**Full cuts list:**
```python
cuts_needed = [80, 60, 40, 120, 75, 45, 90, 55, 100, 65, 35, 85]
stock_length = 200
```

**Goal:** Minimize the number of stock pieces purchased.

**Constraints:**
- Each cut must come from a single stock piece (no gluing)
- Multiple cuts can come from the same stock piece if they fit
- No cut can exceed stock_length
- Total length needed: 850 units
- Theoretical minimum stocks: 5 (if zero waste)

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_cutting_stock(cuts_needed, stock_length)` that:
- Takes a list of cut lengths and the stock length
- Returns a dict with:
  - `"num_stocks"`: Number of stock pieces used (int)
  - `"assignments"`: List of lists, where each inner list contains cut indices assigned to that stock
  - `"waste"`: Total waste (unused length) across all stocks

**Example:**
For cuts=[30, 40, 50] and stock_length=100:
```python
{
    "num_stocks": 2,
    "assignments": [[0, 1], [2]],  # Stock 1: cuts 0,1 (30+40=70), Stock 2: cut 2 (50)
    "waste": 80  # (100-70) + (100-50) = 30 + 50 = 80
}
```

**Algorithm hints:**
- First Fit Decreasing (FFD): Sort cuts descending, place each in first stock that fits
- Best Fit Decreasing (BFD): Place in stock with least remaining space
- Branch and bound for optimal solution
- Dynamic programming for small instances

**Constraints:**
- Solver must complete within 5 minutes
- Use only Python standard library

Write complete Python code with the solve_cutting_stock function.
