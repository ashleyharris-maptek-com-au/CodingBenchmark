You are solving an Orbital Travelling Salesman Problem.

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY number of stations from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: 2-5 stations (simple brute-force permutations feasible)
- **Medium**: 6-10 stations (requires heuristics, some optimization)
- **Large**: 15-20 stations (complex orbital mechanics, needs efficient algorithms)
- **Extreme**: 50-100 stations (very complex, requires advanced heuristics)

**The Challenge:**
Your `solve_orbital_tsp(start_orbit, station_orbits, mu)` function will be tested with 2 to 100 stations. The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Starting position (epoch T=0):**
Position: (-1846.0, -6653.9, -3451.3) km
Velocity: (4.306, 1.937, -5.512) km/s
Altitude: ~1349 km

**Station orbits:**
- 10 available station orbits with varying altitudes and inclinations
- Your function will receive subsets of these stations to visit
- All orbits follow Kepler's laws with Earth's gravity

**Physics constants:**
- Earth gravitational parameter μ = 398600.4418 km³/s²
- Earth radius = 6371 km
- Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinates
- Two-body dynamics (ignore Moon, Sun, atmosphere)
- Instantaneous impulsive burns (delta-V applied instantly)

**Input:**
- `start_orbit`: [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz] - spacecraft initial state
- `station_orbits`: List of [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz] for each station
- `mu`: Gravitational parameter

**Output:**
- Dict with:
  - `"visit_order"`: list of station indices in visitation order
  - `"total_delta_v"`: estimated total delta-V in km/s
  - `"reasoning"`: brief explanation of approach

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on number of stations
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 5 minutes even for 100 stations
3. **Accuracy**: Should provide reasonable delta-V estimates

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library
- Handle varying numbers of stations efficiently
- Provide reasonable orbital transfer estimates

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_orbital_tsp function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on station count.
