You are solving the Longest Common Substring problem.

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY problem size from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: 2-3 short strings (10-50 chars each), simple cases
- **Medium**: 3-5 medium strings (100-500 chars each), moderate complexity
- **Large**: 5-10 long strings (1000-5000 chars each), complex patterns
- **Extreme**: 100 very long strings (10mb+ each), massive search space

**The Challenge:**
Your `longest_common_substring(strings)` function will be tested with problems ranging 
from a few short strings to many very long strings. The same function must work efficiently 
across ALL scales - from trivial to ludicrously large inputs, maintaining correctness and performance.

**Input:**
- `strings`: List of strings to find common substring in

**Output:**
- Longest common substring (as a string)
- If multiple substrings have same max length, return any one
- If no common substring exists (other than empty), return ""

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on number and length of strings
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 5 minutes even for very long strings
3. **Correctness**: Must find the actual longest common substring

**Example:**
```python
strings = ["abcdef", "xbcdey", "zbcdew"]
# Returns: "bcde" (length 4)
```

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library
- Return the actual substring string, not just its length
- Must handle varying numbers and lengths of strings efficiently

Write complete, runnable Python code with the longest_common_substring function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on problem scale.
