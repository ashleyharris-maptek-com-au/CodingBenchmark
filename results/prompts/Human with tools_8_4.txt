You are writing a maze solver.

**Maze format:**
- 'A' = Start position
- 'B' = Goal/End position
- '#' = Wall (cannot pass through)
- ' ' (space) = Open path (can walk through)

**Maze to solve:** (22x20)
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_maze(maze_string)` that:
- Takes the maze as a multi-line string
- Returns a list of (x, y) coordinates representing the path from A to B
- Coordinates are 0-indexed: (0,0) is top-left
- Path should include both start (A) and end (B) positions
- Movement is only up/down/left/right (no diagonals)

**Example output for a simple maze:**
```python
[(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]  # path from A to B
```

**Requirements:**
1. Path must be continuous (each step adjacent to previous)
2. Path must not go through walls ('#')
3. Path must start at 'A' and end at 'B'
4. Shorter paths are better but any valid path scores

**Algorithm hints:**
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) finds shortest path
- DFS (Depth-First Search) finds a path (not necessarily shortest)
- A* is optimal with heuristic

**Constraints:**
- Solver must complete within 5 minutes
- Use only Python standard library
- Return empty list [] if no path exists

Write complete Python code with the solve_maze function.
