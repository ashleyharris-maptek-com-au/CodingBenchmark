You are solving the 1D Cutting Stock Problem.

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY problem size from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: 3-8 cuts, short stock lengths (simple problems, optimal solutions feasible)
- **Medium**: 10-25 cuts, moderate stock lengths (requires heuristics)
- **Large**: 50-100 cuts, long stock lengths (needs efficient algorithms)
- **Extreme**: 200-500 cuts, very long stock lengths (requires advanced heuristics)
- **Ludicrous**: 10000+ cuts, very long stock lengths (requires highly optimized heuristics)

**The Challenge:**
Your `solve_cutting_stock(cuts_needed, stock_length)` function will be tested with problems ranging 
from 3 cuts to 10000 cuts. The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Input:**
- `cuts_needed`: List of cut lengths required
- `stock_length`: Length of wholesale stock pieces

**Output:**
- Dict with:
  - `"num_stocks"`: Number of stock pieces used (int)
  - `"assignments"`: List of lists, where each inner list contains cut indices assigned to that stock
  - `"waste"`: Total waste (unused length) across all stocks


**Example:**
For cuts=[30, 40, 50] and stock_length=100:
```python
{
    "num_stocks": 2,
    "assignments": [[0, 1], [2]],  # Stock 1: cuts 0,1 (30+40=70), Stock 2: cut 2 (50)
    "waste": 80  # (100-70) + (100-50) = 30 + 50 = 80
}
```

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library or numpy
- Each cut must come from a single stock piece (no gluing)
- Multiple cuts can come from the same stock piece if they fit
- No cut can exceed stock_length
- Must handle varying numbers of cuts efficiently

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_cutting_stock function.
