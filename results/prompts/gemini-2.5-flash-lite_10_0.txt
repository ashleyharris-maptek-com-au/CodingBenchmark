You are solving the 2D Cutting Stock Problem (Rectangle Bin Packing).

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY problem size from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: 4-8 rectangles, 100x100-200x150 boards (small problems, exact methods feasible)
- **Ludicrous**: 500-5000 rectangles, 2000x2000-10000x10000 boards (requires very fast heuristics)

**The Challenge:**
Your `solve_2d_cutting(rectangles, board_width, board_height)` function will be tested with problems 
ranging from 4 rectangles to 5000 rectangles on boards up to 10000x10000. The same function must work 
efficiently across all scales.

**Input:**
- `rectangles`: List of (width, height) tuples for pieces to cut
- `board_width`, `board_height`: Dimensions of wholesale boards

**Output:**
- Dictionary with:
  - `"num_boards"`: Number of boards used (int)
  - `"placements"`: List of placements, one per rectangle
    - Each placement: (board_index, x, y, rotated)
    - board_index: which board (0-indexed)
    - x, y: position of rectangle's bottom-left corner on that board
    - rotated: True if rectangle was rotated 90°

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on problem size and board dimensions
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 30 seconds even for 5000 rectangles
3. **Quality**: Minimize number of boards used while producing valid placements

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library or numpy
- Rectangles may be rotated 90° if it helps
- No overlapping allowed
- Rectangles must not exceed board boundaries

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_2d_cutting function.
