You are solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Given 10000 cities in 2D space, find a route that:
1. Visits every city exactly once
2. Returns to the starting city
3. Minimizes total travel distance

The cost between cities is the Euclidean distance.

**Cities (as (x, y) coordinates):**
```python
cities = [
    (360.04, 384.17),  # City 0
    (246.21, 981.68),  # City 1
    (628.87, 228.00),  # City 2
    (587.59, 722.67),  # City 3
    (507.09, 631.75),  # City 4
    (39.36, 447.93),  # City 5
    (170.68, 639.33),  # City 6
    (663.06, 492.71),  # City 7
    (182.54, 691.91),  # City 8
    (949.04, 302.97),  # City 9

    # ... 9985 more cities ...
    (126.77, 907.29),  # City 9995
    (331.04, 227.25),  # City 9996
    (601.36, 360.96),  # City 9997
    (538.46, 184.41),  # City 9998
    (489.59, 150.56),  # City 9999
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_tsp(cities)` that takes a list of (x, y) tuples 
and returns a list of city indices representing the optimal or near-optimal route.

The route should:
- Start at city 0
- Visit all cities exactly once  
- The returned list should NOT include returning to city 0 (that's implicit)

**Constraints:**
- Your solver must complete within 5 minutes
- For 10000 cities, a brute-force approach will NOT work - you need heuristics/optimizations
- You may use only Python standard library (math, itertools, heapq, etc.)

**Example:** For 4 cities, if the optimal route is 0 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 0, 
return `[0, 2, 1, 3]`

Write complete, runnable Python code. Include the solve_tsp function and any helpers needed.
