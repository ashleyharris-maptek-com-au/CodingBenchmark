You are solving a Graph Layout problem (Edge Crossing Minimization).

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY graph size from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: 6-15 nodes, small trees and cycles (planar, 0 crossings achievable)
- **Medium**: 20-100 nodes, dense planar and non-planar graphs
- **Large**: 500-1000 nodes, random dense graphs (many crossings unavoidable)
- **Extreme**: 5000-10000 nodes, very large random graphs

**The Challenge:**
Your `layout_graph(num_nodes, edges)` function will be tested with graphs ranging from 6 nodes to 10,000 nodes. The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Input:**
- `num_nodes`: Number of nodes in the undirected graph (labeled 0 to num_nodes-1)
- `edges`: List of (node1, node2) tuples (unweighted edges)

**Output:**
- List of (x, y) coordinate tuples, one per node
- Coordinates can be any floats
- Goal: Minimize edge crossings when edges are drawn as straight lines

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on graph size and density
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 30 seconds even for 10,000 node graphs
3. **Quality**: Should produce reasonable layouts with minimal crossings
4. **Robustness**: Handle disconnected components, self-loops, and parallel edges gracefully

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library
- Must handle edge cases (empty graphs, single nodes)
- Layout should be valid (coordinates for all nodes)

Write complete, runnable Python code with the layout_graph(num_nodes, edges) function.
