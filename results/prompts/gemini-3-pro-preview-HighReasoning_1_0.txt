You are solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY number of cities from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: 10-40 cities (brute-force feasible for smallest cases)
- **Medium**: 100-1000 cities (requires heuristics)
- **Large**: 5000-100000 cities (requires efficient heuristics)
- **Extreme**: 500000+ cities (requires very fast approximations)

**The Challenge:**
Your `solve_tsp(cities)` function will be tested with city counts ranging from 10 to 500,000. The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Input:**
- `cities`: List of (x, y) tuples representing city coordinates in 2D space [0, 1000]
- The cost between cities is Euclidean distance

**Output:**
- List of city indices representing the route (starting at city 0, visiting all cities exactly once)
- The return list should NOT include returning to city 0 (that's implicit)

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on problem size
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 5 minutes even for 500,000 cities
3. **Quality**: Should produce reasonable routes at all scales

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library (math, itertools, heapq, random, etc.)
- Must handle edge cases (empty list, single city)
- Route must be valid (visits each city exactly once)

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_tsp(cities) function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on the number of cities.
