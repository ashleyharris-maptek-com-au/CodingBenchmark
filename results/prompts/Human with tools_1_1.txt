You are solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Given 20 cities in 2D space, find a route that:
1. Visits every city exactly once
2. Returns to the starting city
3. Minimizes total travel distance

The cost between cities is the Euclidean distance.

**Cities (as (x, y) coordinates):**
```python
cities = [
    (927.99, 173.03),  # City 0
    (970.63, 238.11),  # City 1
    (464.75, 897.76),  # City 2
    (355.77, 508.05),  # City 3
    (161.53, 961.15),  # City 4
    (985.28, 171.69),  # City 5
    (122.76, 472.55),  # City 6
    (518.73, 775.30),  # City 7
    (342.75, 590.10),  # City 8
    (160.33, 212.62),  # City 9
    (78.78, 545.80),  # City 10
    (562.78, 617.00),  # City 11
    (935.63, 306.43),  # City 12
    (342.64, 463.06),  # City 13
    (946.00, 307.40),  # City 14
    (290.46, 426.75),  # City 15
    (689.75, 279.63),  # City 16
    (172.94, 731.73),  # City 17
    (575.14, 579.13),  # City 18
    (13.69, 249.25),  # City 19
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_tsp(cities)` that takes a list of (x, y) tuples 
and returns a list of city indices representing the optimal or near-optimal route.

The route should:
- Start at city 0
- Visit all cities exactly once  
- The returned list should NOT include returning to city 0 (that's implicit)

**Constraints:**
- Your solver must complete within 5 minutes
- For 20 cities, a brute-force approach will NOT work - you need heuristics/optimizations
- You may use only Python standard library (math, itertools, heapq, etc.)

**Example:** For 4 cities, if the optimal route is 0 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 0, 
return `[0, 2, 1, 3]`

Write complete, runnable Python code. Include the solve_tsp function and any helpers needed.
