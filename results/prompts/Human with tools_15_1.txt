You are solving a Shadow Covering problem with tetrahedrons.

**Problem:**
Place tetrahedrons in 3D space such that their combined shadow covers a target 2D polygon.
Minimize the number of tetrahedrons used.

**Target polygon (2D, on z=0 plane):**
```python
target_polygon = [(0.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (4.0, 3.0), (0.0, 3.0)]
```
Area: 12.00 square units
Bounds: x=[0.0, 4.0], y=[0.0, 3.0]

**Sun direction vector (normalized):**
```python
sun_vector = [0.287, 0.000, -0.958]
```
(Points from sun toward ground - shadows project opposite to this)

**Standard tetrahedron (regular, edge ≈ 2 units):**
```python
tetra_vertices = [
    [1.0, 0.0, -0.707],
    [-1.0, 0.0, -0.707],
    [0.0, 1.0, 0.707],
    [0.0, -1.0, 0.707]
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_shadow_cover(target_polygon, sun_vector)` that:
- Takes the target polygon vertices and sun direction
- Returns a dict with:
  - `"count"`: Number of tetrahedrons used
  - `"placements"`: List of placement dicts:
    - `"position"`: [x, y, z] - center position of tetrahedron
    - `"quaternion"`: [w, x, y, z] - rotation (w is scalar)
    - `"scale"`: float - uniform scale factor (default 1.0)

**Shadow projection:**
- Shadow of a point P along sun vector S onto z=0 plane:
  - shadow_x = P.x - P.z * (S.x / S.z)
  - shadow_y = P.y - P.z * (S.y / S.z)
- Tetrahedron shadow is convex hull of its 4 vertex shadows

**Requirements:**
1. Combined shadows must completely cover target polygon
2. Tetrahedrons must not intersect each other in 3D
3. Minimize number of tetrahedrons

**Hints:**
- Place tetrahedrons above (z > 0) the target area
- Larger z = larger shadow (if sun is angled)
- Can scale tetrahedrons to cover more area
- Grid-based placement often works well

**Libraries allowed:** numpy, scipy

Write complete Python code with the solve_shadow_cover function.
