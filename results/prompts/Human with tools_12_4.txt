You are solving a 3D Bin Packing problem.

**Problem:**
Pack as many copies of a polyhedron as possible into an axis-aligned bounding box.

**Container (AABB):** 12 x 12 x 12 units
Origin at (0, 0, 0), extends to (12, 12, 12)

**Polyhedron to pack:** (vertices and triangular faces)
```python
polyhedron = {
    "vertices": [
        [0.00, 0.00, 0.00],
        [2.00, 0.00, 0.00],
        [1.00, 1.73, 0.00],
        [0.00, 0.00, 3.00],
        [2.00, 0.00, 3.00],
        [1.00, 1.73, 3.00]
    ],
    "faces": [[0, 2, 1], [3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 4], [0, 4, 3], [1, 2, 5], [1, 5, 4], [2, 0, 3], [2, 3, 5]]
}
```
Bounding box dimensions: 2.00 x 1.73 x 3.00

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `pack_polyhedra(polyhedron, container_size)` that:
- Takes the polyhedron mesh dict and container (width, height, depth) tuple
- Returns a dict with:
  - `"count"`: Number of polyhedra packed
  - `"placements"`: List of placement dicts:
    - `"translation"`: [x, y, z] - position offset
    - `"quaternion"`: [w, x, y, z] - rotation quaternion (w is scalar part)

**Quaternion rotation:**
- Identity (no rotation): [1, 0, 0, 0]
- 90° around Z: [0.707, 0, 0, 0.707]
- 180° around Z: [0, 0, 0, 1]
- To rotate a point: p' = q * p * q^(-1)

**Requirements:**
1. All polyhedra must be entirely within the container (0 to container_size)
2. No two polyhedra may intersect/overlap
3. Maximize the count of packed polyhedra

**Algorithm hints:**
- Grid-based placement for regular shapes
- Try axis-aligned rotations (24 possible for boxes)
- Use AABB checks for quick rejection
- Layer-by-layer packing strategies
- You may use numpy if needed for quaternion math

**Libraries allowed:** numpy, scipy (for geometry helpers)

**Constraints:**
- Solver must complete within 5 minutes
- Theoretical max (by volume): ~166 (ignoring packing inefficiency)

Write complete Python code with the pack_polyhedra function.
