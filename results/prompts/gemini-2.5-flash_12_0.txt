You are solving a 3D Bin Packing problem.

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY problem size from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: Small containers (5x5x5), simple polyhedra (tetrahedra, cubes)
- **Medium**: Medium containers (10x10x10-20x20x20), moderate complexity polyhedra
- **Large**: Large containers (50x50x50-100x100x100), complex polyhedra
- **Extreme**: Massive containers (200x200x200-500x500x500), very complex geometries

**The Challenge:**
Your `pack_polyhedra(polyhedron, container_size)` function will be tested with containers 
ranging from 5x5x5 to 500x500x500 and various polyhedron complexities. The same function must 
adapt its strategy based on the problem scale and work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Input:**
- `polyhedron`: Dict with "vertices" (list of [x, y, z]) and "faces" (list of triangles)
- `container_size`: Tuple (width, height, depth) of axis-aligned bounding box
- Container origin at (0, 0, 0), extends to (width, height, depth)

**Output:**
- Dict with:
  - `"count"`: Number of polyhedra packed
  - `"placements"`: List of placement dicts:
    - `"translation"`: [x, y, z] - position offset
    - `"quaternion"`: [w, x, y, z] - rotation quaternion (w is scalar part)

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on container size and polyhedron complexity
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 5 minutes even for massive containers
3. **Quality**: Maximize packing count while ensuring valid placements

**Quaternion Rotation Reference:**
- Identity (no rotation): [1, 0, 0, 0]
- 90° around Z: [0.707, 0, 0, 0.707]
- 180° around Z: [0, 0, 0, 1]
- To rotate a point: p' = q * p * q^(-1)

**Constraints:**
- Libraries allowed: any python standard library + numpy, scipy
- All polyhedra must be entirely within the container bounds
- No two polyhedra may intersect/overlap
- Must handle varying container sizes and polyhedron complexities

Write complete, runnable Python code with the pack_polyhedra function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on problem scale.
