You are writing a maze solver that must handle ANY maze complexity from trivial to ludicrous scale:

Your `solve_maze(maze_string)` function will be tested with mazes ranging from 5x5 to 50000x50000. 
The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Maze format:**
- 'A' = Start position
- 'B' = Goal/End position  
- '#' = Wall (cannot pass through)
- ' ' (space) = Open path (can walk through)

**Input:**
- `maze_string`: Multi-line string representing the maze

**Output:**
- List of (x, y) coordinates representing the path from A to B
- Coordinates are 0-indexed: (0,0) is top-left
- Path should include both start (A) and end (B) positions
- Movement is only up/down/left/right (no diagonals)

**Example output for a simple maze:**
```python
[(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]  # path from A to B
```

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library and numpy
- Return empty list [] if no path exists
- Path must be continuous (each step adjacent to previous)
- Path must not go through walls ('#')
- Path must start at 'A' and end at 'B'
- Path must not loop even if the maze allows it.
- If multiple solutions exist, return any one.

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_maze function.
