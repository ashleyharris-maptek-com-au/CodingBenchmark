You are solving a 2D Polygon Cutting Stock Problem.

**The Challenge:**
Your `solve_polygon_cutting(stock_polygon, pieces)` function will be tested with problems 
ranging from 2 simple pieces to 100+ complex polygons. The same function must work efficiently 
across ALL scales, from small test cases to large industrial problems with thousands of pieces 
and varying polygon complexities.

**Input:**
- `stock_polygon`: List of (x, y) vertices defining the stock shape
- `pieces`: List of polygons, each a list of (x, y) vertices

**Output:**
- Dict with:
  - `"num_stocks"`: Number of stock polygons used
  - `"placements"`: List of placement dicts, one per piece:
    - `"stock_index"`: Which stock (0-indexed)
    - `"position"`: (x, y) translation to apply to piece
    - `"rotation"`: Rotation angle in radians

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on number and complexity of pieces
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 5 minutes even for 10000+ complex pieces
3. **Quality**: Minimize stock usage while ensuring valid placements

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library + numpy
- Each placed piece must fit entirely within the stock polygon
- Pieces on same stock must not overlap
- Pieces may be rotated to any angle
- Must handle varying numbers and complexities of pieces

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_polygon_cutting function.
