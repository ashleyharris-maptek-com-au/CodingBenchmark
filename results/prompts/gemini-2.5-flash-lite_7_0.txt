You are implementing a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) Union operation.

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY mesh complexity from trivial (6 vertex unit cubes) to 
ludicrous scale (millions of vertices):
Your `csg_union(mesh_a, mesh_b)` function will be tested with meshes ranging from simple boxes to complex 
polyhedra. The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Input:**
- `mesh_a`, `mesh_b`: Each a dict with:
  - `"vertices"`: List of [x, y, z] coordinates
  - `"faces"`: List of triangles (3 vertex indices each)

**Output:**
- Union mesh in the same format (vertices and faces)
- Must be a valid closed mesh (watertight)
- No duplicate vertices at same position
- Face normals should be consistent (outward-facing)

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on mesh complexity
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 5 minutes even for very complex meshes
3. **Correctness**: Must handle overlapping/intersecting geometry properly

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library + numpy if needed for vector math.
- Result must be a valid mesh dict with "vertices" and "faces"

Write complete, runnable Python code with the csg_union function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on mesh complexity.
