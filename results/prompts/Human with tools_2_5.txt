You are solving the Chinese Postman Problem (Route Inspection Problem).

Given an undirected weighted graph, find the shortest route that:
1. Starts at node 0
2. Traverses EVERY edge at least once
3. Returns to node 0
4. Minimizes total distance traveled

**Graph:** 50 nodes (labeled 0 to 49), 120 edges

**Edges (node1, node2, weight):**
```python
edges = [
    (3, 48, 84),  # Edge between node 3 and 48, weight 84
    (45, 48, 3),  # Edge between node 45 and 48, weight 3
    (3, 7, 12),  # Edge between node 3 and 7, weight 12
    (7, 15, 94),  # Edge between node 7 and 15, weight 94
    (15, 34, 90),  # Edge between node 15 and 34, weight 90
    (3, 39, 10),  # Edge between node 3 and 39, weight 10
    (29, 39, 56),  # Edge between node 29 and 39, weight 56
    (29, 42, 15),  # Edge between node 29 and 42, weight 15
    (7, 17, 77),  # Edge between node 7 and 17, weight 77
    (12, 17, 79),  # Edge between node 12 and 17, weight 79
    (36, 45, 67),  # Edge between node 36 and 45, weight 67
    (23, 42, 55),  # Edge between node 23 and 42, weight 55
    (12, 13, 32),  # Edge between node 12 and 13, weight 32
    (4, 34, 62),  # Edge between node 4 and 34, weight 62
    (12, 32, 94),  # Edge between node 12 and 32, weight 94

    # ... 100 more edges ...
    (4, 44, 8),
    (34, 38, 16),
    (18, 27, 95),
    (43, 45, 20),
    (4, 31, 14),
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_cpp(num_nodes, edges)` that takes:
- `num_nodes`: number of nodes in the graph
- `edges`: list of (node1, node2, weight) tuples

Returns a list of node indices representing the route (starting and ending at node 0).

**Key insight:** 
- If all vertices have even degree, an Eulerian circuit exists (traverse each edge exactly once)
- If some vertices have odd degree, some edges must be traversed twice
- The challenge is minimizing which edges get duplicated

**Constraints:**
- Your solver must complete within 5 minutes
- You may use only Python standard library
- The returned route must visit every edge at least once

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_cpp function.
