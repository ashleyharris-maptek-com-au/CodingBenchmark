You are solving the Chinese Postman Problem (Route Inspection Problem).

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY graph size from trivial to ludicrous scale:
- **Trivial**: 6-20 nodes, 8-45 edges (small graphs, exact algorithms feasible)
- **Medium**: 35-200 nodes, 80-600 edges (requires efficient algorithms)
- **Large**: 500-1000 nodes, 2000-5000 edges (requires optimized implementations)
- **Extreme**: 5000-10000 nodes, 30000-80000 edges (requires very fast algorithms)
- **Epic**: 50000-100000 nodes, 500000-1000000 edges (requires highly optimized algorithms)

**The Challenge:**
Your `solve_cpp(num_nodes, edges)` function will be tested with graphs ranging from 6 nodes to 10,000 nodes. The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Input:**
- `num_nodes`: Number of nodes in the undirected graph (labeled 0 to num_nodes-1)
- `edges`: List of (node1, node2, weight) tuples representing weighted edges

**Output:**
- List of node indices representing the route
- Route must start at node 0, traverse EVERY edge at least once, and return to node 0

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on graph size and complexity
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 30 seconds even for 10,000 node graphs
3. **Correctness**: Must traverse every edge at least once

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library
- Must handle edge cases (disconnected graphs, single nodes)
- Route must be valid and complete

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_cpp(num_nodes, edges) function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on graph size.
