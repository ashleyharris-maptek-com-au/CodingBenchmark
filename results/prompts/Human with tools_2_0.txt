You are solving the Chinese Postman Problem (Route Inspection Problem).

Given an undirected weighted graph, find the shortest route that:
1. Starts at node 0
2. Traverses EVERY edge at least once
3. Returns to node 0
4. Minimizes total distance traveled

**Graph:** 6 nodes (labeled 0 to 5), 8 edges

**Edges (node1, node2, weight):**
```python
edges = [
    (4, 5, 73),  # Edge between node 4 and 5, weight 73
    (1, 5, 21),  # Edge between node 1 and 5, weight 21
    (2, 4, 16),  # Edge between node 2 and 4, weight 16
    (0, 5, 34),  # Edge between node 0 and 5, weight 34
    (3, 5, 81),  # Edge between node 3 and 5, weight 81
    (1, 4, 71),  # Edge between node 1 and 4, weight 71
    (1, 2, 95),  # Edge between node 1 and 2, weight 95
    (3, 4, 65),  # Edge between node 3 and 4, weight 65
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_cpp(num_nodes, edges)` that takes:
- `num_nodes`: number of nodes in the graph
- `edges`: list of (node1, node2, weight) tuples

Returns a list of node indices representing the route (starting and ending at node 0).

**Key insight:** 
- If all vertices have even degree, an Eulerian circuit exists (traverse each edge exactly once)
- If some vertices have odd degree, some edges must be traversed twice
- The challenge is minimizing which edges get duplicated

**Constraints:**
- Your solver must complete within 5 minutes
- You may use only Python standard library
- The returned route must visit every edge at least once

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_cpp function.
