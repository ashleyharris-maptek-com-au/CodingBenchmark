You are solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Given 5000 cities in 2D space, find a route that:
1. Visits every city exactly once
2. Returns to the starting city
3. Minimizes total travel distance

The cost between cities is the Euclidean distance.

**Cities (as (x, y) coordinates):**
```python
cities = [
    (214.59, 948.32),  # City 0
    (529.59, 138.99),  # City 1
    (741.23, 881.19),  # City 2
    (7.06, 264.94),  # City 3
    (776.31, 826.41),  # City 4
    (919.17, 796.28),  # City 5
    (648.91, 220.46),  # City 6
    (711.31, 902.96),  # City 7
    (734.68, 265.54),  # City 8
    (997.36, 500.91),  # City 9

    # ... 4985 more cities ...
    (60.70, 240.91),  # City 4995
    (917.10, 156.12),  # City 4996
    (782.54, 134.99),  # City 4997
    (456.16, 583.48),  # City 4998
    (473.07, 600.20),  # City 4999
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_tsp(cities)` that takes a list of (x, y) tuples 
and returns a list of city indices representing the optimal or near-optimal route.

The route should:
- Start at city 0
- Visit all cities exactly once  
- The returned list should NOT include returning to city 0 (that's implicit)

**Constraints:**
- Your solver must complete within 5 minutes
- For 5000 cities, a brute-force approach will NOT work - you need heuristics/optimizations
- You may use only Python standard library (math, itertools, heapq, etc.)

**Example:** For 4 cities, if the optimal route is 0 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 0, 
return `[0, 2, 1, 3]`

Write complete, runnable Python code. Include the solve_tsp function and any helpers needed.
