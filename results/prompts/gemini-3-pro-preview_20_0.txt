You are writing a Rust program to validate drillhole assay data.


**The Challenge:**
Your Rust program will be tested with drillhole datasets ranging from small exploration projects to 
massive mining surveys. The same program must work efficiently across ALL scales from 10 holes to
200,000 holes.

**Problem:**
Given drillhole data from a mining exploration project, identify samples that likely contain typos or 
measurement errors. These outliers don't correlate well with spatially neighboring data points.

**Target environment specs**
Platform: Windows 11 (build 10.0.26100)
Architecture: AMD64
CPU: Intel64 Family 6 Model 158 Stepping 10, GenuineIntel
Core count: 12
Memory: 31.93 GB
SIMD: AVX, AVX2, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, SSSE3
SIMD detail: AVX=yes, AVX-512F=no, AVX2=yes, SSE=yes, SSE2=yes, SSE3=yes, SSE4.1=yes, SSE4.2=yes, SSSE3=yes

**Rust Compiler information**
rustc 1.92.0 (ded5c06cf 2025-12-08) | edition=2024 | host: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

**Drillhole Data:**
- Each hole has a 3D path: start point (x,y,z) + direction vector + length
- Samples are taken at intervals along each hole
- Each sample has measurements for multiple properties

**Input format (stdin):**
```
num_holes num_properties
property_name_1 property_name_2 ...
hole_id start_x start_y start_z dir_x dir_y dir_z length num_samples
depth prop1 prop2 ...
depth prop1 prop2 ...
etc.
hole_id start_x start_y start_z dir_x dir_y dir_z length num_samples
```

**Output format (stdout):**
```
M                                             (number of suspect entries found)
hole_id sample_idx property_name confidence   (for each suspect, sorted by confidence desc)
```

**Requirements:**
1. Program must compile with rustc and only the standard rust library.
2. Read from stdin, write to stdout
3. Handle up to thousands of holes with thousands of samples each
4. Complete within 5 minutes
5. Report at least the most obvious outliers
6. Confidence score should reflect how anomalous the value is
7. Must handle varying dataset sizes efficiently

Write complete, compilable Rust code with a main function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on dataset scale.

The program should be robust enough to handle edge cases like missing data, duplicate entries, and varying data distributions.
