You are solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

Given 500000 cities in 2D space, find a route that:
1. Visits every city exactly once
2. Returns to the starting city
3. Minimizes total travel distance

The cost between cities is the Euclidean distance.

**Cities (as (x, y) coordinates):**
```python
cities = [
    (541.08, 382.72),  # City 0
    (386.42, 816.13),  # City 1
    (628.88, 984.22),  # City 2
    (858.52, 200.32),  # City 3
    (849.15, 821.52),  # City 4
    (541.53, 21.01),  # City 5
    (759.76, 846.32),  # City 6
    (807.11, 756.97),  # City 7
    (111.08, 138.33),  # City 8
    (678.11, 298.83),  # City 9

    # ... 499985 more cities ...
    (329.47, 658.93),  # City 499995
    (869.23, 353.26),  # City 499996
    (375.24, 65.61),  # City 499997
    (683.40, 378.87),  # City 499998
    (279.17, 226.36),  # City 499999
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_tsp(cities)` that takes a list of (x, y) tuples 
and returns a list of city indices representing the optimal or near-optimal route.

The route should:
- Start at city 0
- Visit all cities exactly once  
- The returned list should NOT include returning to city 0 (that's implicit)

**Constraints:**
- Your solver must complete within 5 minutes
- For 500000 cities, a brute-force approach will NOT work - you need heuristics/optimizations
- You may use only Python standard library (math, itertools, heapq, etc.)

**Example:** For 4 cities, if the optimal route is 0 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 0, 
return `[0, 2, 1, 3]`

Write complete, runnable Python code. Include the solve_tsp function and any helpers needed.
