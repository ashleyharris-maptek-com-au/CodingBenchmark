You are writing C# code to calculate an asteroid interception trajectory.

You must write a C# solver that can handle ANY interception and redirection scenarios, from
short warning times (1-2 years), large impactors, generous delta-v, simple trajectories to 
very long warning times (30-50 years), very small impactors, very tight delta-v, 
advanced trajectory optimization with multi-flyby maneuvers and gravitational assist sequences required.

**Problem:**
Calculate a spacecraft trajectory to intercept and deflect an asteroid on collision course 
with Earth using kinetic impact. The simulation uses a simplified N-body model of the solar system 
with Sun, Earth, Moon, and major planets.

**The solver must output:**
1. Launch window and initial trajectory
2. Mid-course correction burns
3. Final approach for kinetic impact

**Input format (stdin):**
```
num_bodies
body_name mass x y z vx vy vz  (for each body)
spacecraft_mass delta_v_budget
warning_time_years
```

**Output format (stdout):**
```
launch_time burn_dv_x burn_dv_y burn_dv_z
correction_time1 burn_dv_x burn_dv_y burn_dv_z
...
impact_time impact_dv_x impact_dv_y impact_dv_z
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Spacecraft intercepts asteroid before Earth impact
- Kinetic impact deflects asteroid sufficiently to miss Earth
- Total delta-v usage stays within budget
- Launch occurs within specified window

**Failure Criteria:**
- Miss intercept opportunity
- Insufficient deflection
- Exceed delta-v budget
- Launch window missed
