You are solving a 3D Packing problem: Pack regular tetrahedrons into polyhedra.

You must write a Python solver that can handle ANY container size from trivial to ludicrous scale.

Your `pack_tetrahedrons(container_vertices, edge_length)` function will be tested with containers 
ranging from small boxes to massive 500-unit cubes. The same function must work efficiently across ALL scales.

**Input:**
- `container_vertices`: List of (x, y, z) tuples defining a convex polyhedron
- `edge_length`: Fixed edge length for all regular tetrahedrons

**Output:**
- List of tetrahedron placements
- Each placement is a dict with:
  - `"center"`: (x, y, z) tuple - center of the tetrahedron
  - `"rotation"`: (rx, ry, rz) tuple - Euler angles in radians

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Scalability**: Your algorithm must adapt based on container volume and complexity
2. **Performance**: Must complete within 30 seconds even for massive containers
3. **Quality**: Maximize number of tetrahedrons while ensuring no overlaps

**Algorithm Strategy Recommendations:**
- **Small containers**: Can use precise geometric algorithms, dense packing
- **Medium containers**: Grid-based placement, local optimization
- **Large containers**: Coarse grid placement, simple heuristics
- **Very Large containers**: Very coarse placement, possibly stochastic methods

**Key Geometry (regular tetrahedron, edge length e=1.0):**
- Height: h = e * sqrt(2/3) ≈ 0.8165
- Circumradius: R = e * sqrt(3/8) ≈ 0.6124
- Inradius: r = e / sqrt(24) ≈ 0.2041

**Implementation Hints:**
- Detect container volume and choose appropriate algorithm
- Use efficient collision detection for large numbers of tetrahedrons
- Consider using spatial partitioning (grid/octree) for large problems
- Implement adaptive quality vs speed tradeoffs
- For very large containers, consider simplified placement strategies

**Constraints:**
- Use only Python standard library
- Each tetrahedron must be entirely inside the container
- Tetrahedrons must not overlap each other
- Maximize the number of tetrahedrons packed

Write complete, runnable Python code with the pack_tetrahedrons function.
Include adaptive logic that chooses different strategies based on container size.
