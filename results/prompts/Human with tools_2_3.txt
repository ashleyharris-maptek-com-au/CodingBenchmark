You are solving the Chinese Postman Problem (Route Inspection Problem).

Given an undirected weighted graph, find the shortest route that:
1. Starts at node 0
2. Traverses EVERY edge at least once
3. Returns to node 0
4. Minimizes total distance traveled

**Graph:** 20 nodes (labeled 0 to 19), 45 edges

**Edges (node1, node2, weight):**
```python
edges = [
    (2, 15, 73),  # Edge between node 2 and 15, weight 73
    (2, 12, 19),  # Edge between node 2 and 12, weight 19
    (11, 15, 51),  # Edge between node 11 and 15, weight 51
    (5, 15, 21),  # Edge between node 5 and 15, weight 21
    (11, 19, 39),  # Edge between node 11 and 19, weight 39
    (16, 19, 54),  # Edge between node 16 and 19, weight 54
    (6, 12, 81),  # Edge between node 6 and 12, weight 81
    (9, 12, 14),  # Edge between node 9 and 12, weight 14
    (13, 15, 74),  # Edge between node 13 and 15, weight 74
    (3, 16, 24),  # Edge between node 3 and 16, weight 24
    (7, 12, 79),  # Edge between node 7 and 12, weight 79
    (8, 16, 26),  # Edge between node 8 and 16, weight 26
    (1, 16, 52),  # Edge between node 1 and 16, weight 52
    (3, 4, 78),  # Edge between node 3 and 4, weight 78
    (2, 14, 53),  # Edge between node 2 and 14, weight 53

    # ... 25 more edges ...
    (1, 17, 28),
    (12, 18, 11),
    (8, 17, 62),
    (4, 16, 98),
    (10, 18, 41),
]
```

**Your task:**
Write a Python function `solve_cpp(num_nodes, edges)` that takes:
- `num_nodes`: number of nodes in the graph
- `edges`: list of (node1, node2, weight) tuples

Returns a list of node indices representing the route (starting and ending at node 0).

**Key insight:** 
- If all vertices have even degree, an Eulerian circuit exists (traverse each edge exactly once)
- If some vertices have odd degree, some edges must be traversed twice
- The challenge is minimizing which edges get duplicated

**Constraints:**
- Your solver must complete within 5 minutes
- You may use only Python standard library
- The returned route must visit every edge at least once

Write complete, runnable Python code with the solve_cpp function.
